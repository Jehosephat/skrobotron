# skrobotron

Simple web-based scoreboard inspired by the GymScoreboard PRD. It creates temporary sessions for a basketball-style scoreboard and synchronizes score updates between control and display views in real time.

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to create a session. Use the generated control and display links to manage and view the scoreboard.
